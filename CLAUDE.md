# CLAUDE.md - TreeMapper

## Project Overview

treemapper is a Python tool that converts directory structures to YAML format, designed specifically for use with Large Language Models (LLMs). It maps entire codebases into structured YAML files, making it easy to analyze code, document projects, and work with AI tools.

## Development Environment

- Python 3.9+ required
- Package dependencies: pathspec, pyyaml

## Building and Installation

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build distribution package
python -m build

# Install from PyPI
pip install treemapper
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_basic.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_basic.py::test_basic_mapping

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src/treemapper

# Run tests in verbose mode
pytest -v
```

## Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Run flake8 linter
flake8 src/treemapper

# Run black formatter
black src/treemapper

# Run type checking with mypy
mypy src/treemapper

# Run autoflake to remove unused imports
autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports -i src/treemapper/*.py

# Run pre-commit hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run isort (import sorting)
isort src/treemapper tests
```

## Code Quality Tools

The project includes comprehensive code quality checks via CI and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Complexity analysis
radon cc src/treemapper/ --min B  # Cyclomatic complexity
radon mi src/treemapper/ --min B  # Maintainability index

# Mutation testing (test effectiveness)
mutmut run --paths-to-mutate=src/treemapper/

# Architecture checks (import contracts)
lint-imports

# Coverage reporting
pytest --cov=src/treemapper --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### CI/CD Workflows

The project has two CI/CD workflows:

1. **Main CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Comprehensive quality checks
   - Pre-commit hook validation (all hooks)
   - Linting and type checking (flake8, black, mypy)
   - Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Python version matrix (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
   - PyPy compatibility testing (pypy-3.9, pypy-3.10)
   - Test coverage with 80% threshold and branch analysis
   - Mutation testing (test effectiveness validation)
   - Complexity and maintainability metrics (radon)
   - Architecture/import contract validation (import-linter)
   - SonarCloud quality gate (code quality analysis)

2. **CD (Release)** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`): Atomic releases
   - Version bump with git bundles
   - Multi-platform binary builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - PyPI publishing (optional)
   - GitHub release creation with assets

## Project Architecture

The codebase is organized as follows:

- `src/treemapper/`: Main package
  - `treemapper.py`: Entry point and main orchestration
  - `cli.py`: Command-line argument parsing
  - `ignore.py`: Logic for handling ignore patterns (gitignore, treemapperignore)
  - `tree.py`: Core tree building functionality
  - `writer.py`: YAML output formatting and file writing
  - `logger.py`: Logging configuration

The application flow is:
1. Parse command-line arguments (`cli.py`)
2. Set up logging based on verbosity level (`logger.py`)
3. Load ignore patterns from various sources (`ignore.py`)
4. Build the directory tree structure (`tree.py`)
5. Write the tree structure to a YAML file (`writer.py`)

## Running the Application

```bash
# Map current directory
treemapper .

# Map specific directory
treemapper /path/to/dir

# Custom output file
treemapper . -o my-tree.yaml

# Custom ignore patterns
treemapper . -i ignore.txt

# Disable all default ignores
treemapper . --no-default-ignores

# Set verbosity level (0=ERROR, 1=WARNING, 2=INFO, 3=DEBUG)
treemapper . -v 3
```

## Creating a Distribution Package

```bash
# Build package
python -m build

# Create executable with PyInstaller
pyinstaller treemapper.spec
```
