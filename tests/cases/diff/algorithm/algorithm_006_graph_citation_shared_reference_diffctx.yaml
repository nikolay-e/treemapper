    ## Algorithm Design

    According to [@smith2020], the approach works well for convex functions.
    We extend this by incorporating ideas from [@jones2019] and adding
    a novel regularization term:

    1. Initialize weights randomly
    2. Compute gradient using mini-batch
    3. Apply adaptive learning rate from [@jones2019]
    4. Add L2 regularization with decay schedule
    5. Update weights using momentum from [@smith2020]
