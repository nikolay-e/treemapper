docs/architecture.md: '# Main Section - System Architecture


  This is a comprehensive section covering the main system architecture.

  The system is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind.


  ## Overview


  The architecture follows a microservices pattern with the following components:

  - API Gateway

  - Authentication Service

  - Data Processing Pipeline

  - Storage Layer


  ## Key Design Decisions


  1. Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

  2. CQRS pattern for read/write separation

  3. Eventual consistency for distributed data


  ### Implementation Details


  The implementation uses several key technologies:

  - Python for backend services

  - PostgreSQL for persistent storage

  - Redis for caching layer


  More detailed information follows in subsequent sections.


  ## Performance Considerations


  Response time targets:

  - API calls: < 100ms p95

  - Background jobs: < 5s p99


  This concludes the main architecture section.
