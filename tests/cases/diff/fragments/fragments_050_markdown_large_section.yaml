    # Main Section - System Architecture

    This is a comprehensive section covering the main system architecture.
    The system is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind.

    ## Overview

    The architecture follows a microservices pattern with the following components:
    - API Gateway
    - Authentication Service
    - Data Processing Pipeline
    - Storage Layer

    ## Key Design Decisions

    1. Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
    2. CQRS pattern for read/write separation
    3. Eventual consistency for distributed data

    ### Implementation Details

    The implementation uses several key technologies:
    - Python for backend services
    - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
    - Redis for caching layer

    More detailed information follows in subsequent sections.

    ## Performance Considerations

    Response time targets:
    - API calls: < 100ms p95
    - Background jobs: < 5s p99

    This concludes the main architecture section.
