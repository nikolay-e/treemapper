# Diff Test Cases Enrichment

## Goal

Enrich all diff test cases with:

1. **Realistic code content** - larger, more representative code snippets
2. **Garbage files** - files with unique markers to test exclusion
3. **Proper diffctx format** - structured assertions

## File Structure

Each test case consists of 3 files:

- `{name}_before.yaml` - codebase state before the change
- `{name}_after.yaml` - codebase state after the change
- `{name}_diffctx.yaml` - assertions for diff context selection

## Garbage Marker Pattern

```
GARBAGE_{CATEGORY}_{NUM}_{DESCRIPTION}_{LETTER}
```

Examples:

- `GARBAGE_CICD_003_ROLLBACK_MARKER_A`
- `GARBAGE_ALGO_005_LOGGING_MARKER_B`

## diffctx Format

```yaml
must_include_files:
  - path/to/important/file.py
must_include_content:
  - |
    actual code block that must appear
must_not_include:
  - GARBAGE_MARKER_A
  - GarbageClassName
  - garbage_file.py
```

### 🔄 Remaining

None - all directories enriched.

## Process

For each test case:

1. **Read** all 3 files (before, after, diffctx)
2. **Check** if already enriched (look for garbage markers)
3. **Enrich** if minimal:
   - Add realistic code to before/after
   - Add 2 garbage files with unique markers
   - Update diffctx to proper format
4. **Write** updated files

## Notes

- Process one directory at a time
- Use consistent garbage marker naming per directory
- Keep code realistic for the test scenario
- Ensure diffctx assertions match actual diff content
