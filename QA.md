# QA Methodology

## CI

- CI matrix: Linux/macOS/Windows × Python 3.10-3.14
  (15 test matrices + 3 lint/arch jobs)
- Windows jobs slowest — typically 7-10min vs 2-4min for Linux/macOS
- All jobs must pass; no flaky CI tolerance

## SonarCloud

- Project key: `nikolay-e_TreeMapper`
- Dominant issue pattern: cognitive complexity (python:S3776)
  — 30+ instances in diffctx pipeline
- Benchmark PRNG (python:S2245) hotspots are safe — not crypto usage
- Regex DoS hotspot (python:S5852) in semantic parsers — review case-by-case
- Duplicate branch smell (python:S1871) in discovery methods:
  merge with `or` when bodies identical
- Test YAML fixture "Password" triggers false positive VULNERABILITY
  (yaml:S2068) — expected
- `dataclasses.replace()` return type: mypy (modern) infers correctly —
  do NOT add `cast(T, replace(...))`, mypy will flag as redundant-cast;
  remove cast and let type inference work
- Lambda capturing loop variable (S1515): use `dict.__getitem__` instead
  of `lambda k: d[k]` — simpler and avoids the flag

## Test Suite

- Run `python -m pytest --tb=no -q` for quick status
- test_graph.py separate from test_yaml_diff.py — check both
- Many xfails (strict=False) for bidirectional discovery precision tradeoff —
  check count trends, not absolute numbers

## Code Review

- Check for duplicate decorators (e.g. double `@staticmethod`)
  — Python silently allows stacking
- After merging duplicate branches (S1871 fix), verify the `or`
  logic preserves both conditions

## SonarCloud (extras)

- `whitelist_vulture.py` bare names (`Graph.add_node`) trigger S905
  "no side effects" BUG — wrap in `_ = expr` to silence (vulture
  still recognizes the reference)
- `numpy_array /= divisor` (in-place mutation) is misread by SonarCloud as
  unused local — use explicit `np.divide(arr, divisor, out=arr)` instead
- Pinning `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@<sha>` requires explicit
  `with: toolchain: stable` — pinning loses the default-input behavior
- API to mark hotspot Safe:
  `POST /api/hotspots/change_status hotspot=KEY status=REVIEWED resolution=SAFE`
- API to mark issue false-positive:
  `POST /api/issues/do_transition issue=KEY transition=falsepositive`
- GraphML XML namespace `http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/graphml` triggers
  S5332 (insecure http) but is the literal spec identifier — mark Safe

## Cognitive Complexity Tactics

- run_parallel-style "parallel-or-serial dispatcher" with extend/append:
  extract `_collect_result(results, r, collect)` helper to dedupe both
  branches and reduce S3776 score significantly
- evaluate_one-style "header → run → report → return" functions:
  extract `_print_*_header` and `_print_*_dump` helpers — the heavy
  formatting blocks dominate the complexity score

## Shell Scripts

- `shelldre:S7688` — convert every `[ ... ]` to `[[ ... ]]` across the
  whole file in one pass; SonarCloud reported lines drift after pre-commit
  reformatting, so don't trust line numbers literally
- `shelldre:S7682` — one-line tee/printf functions like `log() { ... }`
  also need an explicit `return 0`; SonarCloud reports the line BEFORE
  the function definition
- `bash -n script.sh` after edits — quick syntactic sanity check

## Pre-existing Test Failures (do not regress, do not retry-fix)

- `tests/test_graph.py`, `test_graph_cli.py`, `test_graph_export.py` —
  ALL three fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: treemapper.diffctx.edges`.
  Python `edges` module was deleted in commit `e77d5494` (Rust-only
  pipeline); CI excludes them via three `--ignore=...` flags in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Reproduce locally with the same flags
  before claiming "tests pass". Do NOT delete these files until
  ProjectGraph is ported to Rust — they document the contract.

## SonarCloud API

- Public `api/issues/search?projectKeys=nikolay-e_TreeMapper&statuses=OPEN`
  works without auth for OPEN issues. Token only needed for hotspot
  state changes / false-positive transitions.
- Token lives in macOS Keychain under service `sonarqube-token` (40 chars).
  Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (NOT basic auth). Use
  `--data-urlencode key=value` for hotspot/issue mutations.
- Quality gate ERROR conditions for treemapper after a paper-heavy push are
  usually `new_reliability_rating>1` (driven by S3516 BLOCKER bugs) and
  `new_security_hotspots_reviewed<100%`. Hotspots are bulk-resolvable in
  one loop over `/api/hotspots/search?status=TO_REVIEW` — set Safe with
  per-rule comments (S1313 instance-id false positive, S2245 seeded PRNG,
  docker S6471 internal image, S7637 tag-pin policy). Hotspots resolved
  this way DO clear the gate condition immediately on next refresh.

## SonarCloud Recurring Patterns (paper/benchmark commits)

- `python:S3516` BLOCKER on entry-points and orchestrators: appears when a
  function has multiple `return X` statements all of the same name (e.g.
  `return results`) — refactor into single tail-return by extracting
  per-branch helpers, NOT by collapsing branches.
- `python:S5799` MAJOR (implicit string concat / missing comma): black
  often line-splits long f-strings into adjacent literals (`"..." "..."`).
  Merge into one literal — keep flake8 / ruff aligned with this rule by
  not relying on implicit concat for readability.
- `python:S1244` MAJOR (float `==`): use `pytest.approx`, not `math.isclose`,
  because the codebase already imports pytest in every test module.
- `python:S1186` CRITICAL (empty methods): for duck-typed stubs (e.g.
  Aider IO interface) add a one-line docstring describing the no-op —
  `pass` alone is flagged.
- `python:S1192` CRITICAL (literal duplication ≥3): extract module-private
  `_TWO_COL_DIVIDER` style constant; keep adjacent to imports.

## CI Build of Rust Extension

- Test matrix needs `_diffctx` (Rust ext) installed before pytest. Use
  `maturin build --release --out wheelhouse && pip install --force-reinstall
  --no-deps wheelhouse/*.whl` — `maturin develop` requires a venv which the
  GH runner doesn't have by default.
- Set `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` for Python versions newer than
  PyO3's max supported (currently 3.13). Without this, 3.14+ matrix entries
  fail at the build step before any test runs.
- Cache cargo per-(os, python-version) — same cargo target dir compiled with
  different Python ABIs collides if the key doesn't include python-version.
- `panic = "abort"` in `[profile.release]` is INCOMPATIBLE with
  `cargo test --release` — the test harness force-uses unwind, dependencies
  get abort, link fails. Keep abort for production safety but split CI:
  `cargo test --lib` (dev profile, harness happy) +
  `cargo build --release` + `cargo test --release --test yaml_cases`
  (integration tests with `harness = false` work in release).
- Bench Dockerfile that copies `diffctx/Cargo.toml` MUST also copy
  `diffctx/tests/` whenever Cargo.toml declares any `[[test]]` entry —
  manifest parser validates path before any build step.

## YAML Case Runner (cargo integration test)

- Default `cargo test --release` runs every YAML case in `tests/cases/diff/`
  via `tests/yaml_cases.rs` — 2723 trials, ~70s at -j8. Cap with
  `DIFFCTX_YAML_CASES_LIMIT=N` env var for fast pre-commit (default in
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is 20). CI rust-diffctx-test job uses the same
  cap to avoid surfacing 269 long-tail failures as fresh CI noise.
- libtest-mimic is the harness — every YAML case becomes its own Trial
  visible in `cargo test` output. Cases with stale `xfail:` markers may
  pass ("xpass"); strip via `--ignored` sweep when the algorithm improves.
- Pass threshold (`DIFFCTX_YAML_MIN_SCORE`) defaults to 10% recall × (1 −
  forbidden_rate). Original Python framework used the same value.

## Memory Profiling for diffctx

- `/usr/bin/time -l` on macOS reports `peak memory footprint` and
  `maximum resident set size`. Run 3× and take median — single run
  varies by ~500MB on small diffs (rayon thread allocator cache noise)
- Peak on small diffs over treemapper itself is ~1.6–2.0 GB; dominated
  by `build_file_cache` (200MB cap, but reads ALL <100KB files into
  `Vec<(PathBuf, String)>` BEFORE applying the cap) and tree-sitter
  parse trees, NOT lexical similarity. Lexical fixes only show up on
  repos with many fragments + dense term overlap.

## Local pre-commit Environment

- Repo uses `.venv/bin/python`. `pip install -e .` and `maturin develop`
  must be invoked via `python -m pip` and `python -m maturin` (or after
  `source .venv/bin/activate`); `maturin` from homebrew installs into the
  wrong env and `_diffctx` won't be importable
- `import-linter` pre-commit hook depends on `treemapper` being importable
  from the venv — requires `_diffctx` to be built (`maturin develop --release
  --features python`). Don't `SKIP=lint-imports` — fix the env.
- `name-tests-test` hook treats every `tests/**/*.py` as a candidate test
  and demands `test_*.py` naming. Add fixture dirs to its `exclude:` regex
  in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Currently excluded: `diffctx/tests/fixtures/garbage/.*\.py`

## Cargo features and `dep:` syntax

- Optional tree-sitter grammars are split into `lang-core` (top-15) and
  `lang-extra` (long-tail) features in `diffctx/Cargo.toml`. Default is
  `["lang-core", "lang-extra"]` so `cargo build` is unchanged
- **WATCH OUT**: `feature = ["dep:tree-sitter-X"]` SUPPRESSES the auto-feature
  named `tree-sitter-X`. `#[cfg(feature = "tree-sitter-X")]` will then
  evaluate to false and the language won't load. Use bare names without
  `dep:` so the auto-feature is preserved
- Adding a new grammar: bump optional dep in `[dependencies]`, append to the
  matching feature list (`lang-core` or `lang-extra`) WITHOUT `dep:` prefix,
  add `#[cfg]`-gated insert in `tree_sitter_strategy.rs::LANGUAGE_CACHE`

## Windows CI Compatibility

- `fcntl` is Unix-only; `msvcrt.locking` is the Windows equivalent. For code
  that runs on CI (not on the bench server), guard Unix-only imports:

  ```python
  try:
      import fcntl as _fcntl
  except ImportError:
      _fcntl = None  # type: ignore[assignment]
  ```

- Bench jobs (common.py, diffctx_eval_fn.py) import `fcntl` only for the
  `_cache_lock` function — benchmark code never runs on Windows, but the
  test suite imports these modules. The `try/except` pattern keeps tests
  runnable on Windows while bench logic remains Linux-only.

## Bench Sweep Smoke QA

- **Always read GH Actions logs in full before diagnosing failures** — summary
  counts (n_ok/n_total) do not distinguish between bugs and expected infra failures.
  Two common false-positive patterns:
  - `oom_kill` (SIGKILL -9) on large repos like `astropy/astropy` — expected on GH
    runners with 7GB RAM; not a bug in the algorithm.
  - `clone_fail` / `clone_timeout` — transient network or GH rate-limit; retry or
    skip, not a code regression.
- **Picklable eval functions** — eval_fn passed to pebble `ProcessPool.schedule()`
  must be picklable. Local closures (`def eval_fn(...)` inside a factory function)
  are NOT picklable. Use `functools.partial` + module-level function.
  Attaching `.shutdown` as a lambda is also not picklable — use a module-level
  `_noop_shutdown` function.
- `make_aider_eval_fn` was fixed to use `functools.partial(_pool_eval_aider, ...)`.
  The `_AiderProcess` is now created lazily per-worker-process via a module-level
  `_AIDER_PROC` global (no inter-process sharing needed).

## actionlint context restrictions

- `${{ env.X }}` is BANNED inside `env:` blocks at any level (workflow, job,
  step). Available contexts inside `env:` are: github, inputs, matrix,
  needs, secrets, vars
- Fix: inline literal values, or read `$X` from shell scripts in `run:` (the
  surrounding env vars from outer scope are inherited as shell vars)

## GitHub Actions security rules (SonarCloud)

- `githubactions:S7630` BLOCKER: `${{ inputs.xxx }}` used directly in `run:`
  block = script injection. Fix: assign each input to an `env:` key on the
  step, then read via `${ENV_VAR}` in the shell. Never interpolate `inputs.*`
  inline in shell.
- `githubactions:S8264` MAJOR: workflow-level `permissions:` block must be
  moved to individual job level. Each job already has or should have its own
  `permissions:` key. Workflow-level is too broad.
- `shellcheck SC2002`: `cat file | cmd` → `cmd < file` (useless cat)
- `shellcheck SC2015`: `A && B || C` is not if-then-else; use `if A; then B; fi`

## YAML heredoc indentation in GitHub Actions

- Python/shell code inside a `run: |` heredoc must be indented to at least
  10 spaces (matching block scalar indentation) — YAML strips those spaces
  before passing to bash, so the script sees the code at column 0. Code at
  0 spaces in the YAML file terminates the block scalar prematurely.
- `PYEOF` heredoc terminator also needs 10 spaces of YAML indentation (becomes
  column 0 in the shell script, correctly terminating the heredoc).
- Use `<< 'PYEOF'` (quoted) to prevent bash expansion of Python f-strings and
  GitHub Actions expressions are pre-expanded by GH before bash sees the script.

## SonarCloud exclusions

- `sonar.exclusions=diffctx/tests/fixtures/garbage/**` — fixture files
  intentionally have unused params (S1172) and dead code; they simulate
  "fake real code" as negative-test distractors

## Cognitive Complexity Backlog

`python:S3776` issues that cross the 15 threshold and weren't refactored in
this QA pass (touching benchmark code = regression risk on v1 results):

- `benchmarks/baselines/aider_baseline.py:112` (28→15)
- `benchmarks/baselines/aider_baseline.py:135` (23→15)
- `benchmarks/baselines/bm25_baseline.py:41` (32→15)
- `benchmarks/aggregate_sweep.py:100` (23→15)
- `benchmarks/adapters/multi_swebench.py:100` (17→15)
- `benchmarks/diffctx_eval_fn.py:70` (18→15)
- `benchmarks/diffctx_eval_fn.py:241` (19→15)
- `benchmarks/adapters/calibrate.py:73` (25→15) — `evaluate_grid` retry/pool loop
- `benchmarks/adapters/calibrate.py:160` (40→15) — `evaluate_grid_cached`, already
  `# noqa: C901` for ruff (orchestration with timeout/exception/checkpoint dispatch
  does not factor cleanly without behavior change)
- `benchmarks/adapters/evaluator.py:49` (32→15)
Tactic from earlier passes (already in this file): extract `_collect_result`
helpers and `_print_*_header`/`_print_*_dump` blocks. Pair with v2 evaluation
re-run so any drift is caught.
